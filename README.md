# traceroute
Utility library for parsing traceroute output and some other utility IP functions.

Not really interesting for public consumption, but some intersting functions for
parsing out IP or hostname and port info from strings of text that might contain them
somewhere.

Also utility functions for listing the current host's local IPs and checking whether
a given IP is public or not.
